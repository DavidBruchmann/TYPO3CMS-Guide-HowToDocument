============================
Spelling, terms and glossary
============================

.. index:: pair: Text role; pn (proper name)

*Very much recommended:* Make use of text role `pn` (proper name) to point out
that some special spelling is applied due to a proper name like
`TYPO3 Core Team`:pn:. The recommended way for markup is:

.. code-block:: rst

   `TYPO3 Core Team`:pn:

Having `:pn:` at then end facilitates reading. In future Sphinx will be able
to automatically create a list of all proper names used in a manual.

Currently the 'pn' textrole is defined in file :file:`Includes.rst.txt`. It is
a derivative of 'emphasis' and rendered in html as `<em class="pn">`. Visual
appearance is italics, but that may changed in future.
