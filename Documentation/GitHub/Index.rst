Issues
=============

Pick an issue for a topic you are familiar with and try to fix it. Some of the
issues address a problem, some are enhancements where new text needs to be
written.


Find open issues
----------------

To find the issues for a specific manual click on :guilabel:`Related Links` (on the
bottom left of any page of the manual) and then :guilabel:`Issues`.

But, you may want to get an overview for all open issues for TYPO3 documentation.
The repositories of the official manuals are all included in the organization
`TYPO3-Documentation <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation>`__.

Here are some links you can use to get a list of all issues:

.. note::

   GitHub will show a 404 page if you are not logged in following these links!
   So, remember to log in first!

For New Contributors
--------------------

* `Good first issues <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20archived%3Afalse%20user%3ATYPO3-Documentation>`__

We added a label "Good first issue" which is used to tag issues that outline
a small task that may be good to get started. But, you are not restricted to
this! Start with any issue that seems to be a good fit for you!

For Contributors
----------------

* `Open, unassigned issues  <https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3ATYPO3-Documentation+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2FT3DocTeam+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2Ft3SphinxThemeRtd+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2FTYPO3CMS-Guide-HowToDocument+no%3Aassignee>`__ (without team issues, without t3SphinxThemeRtd, without "Writing Documentation")

This includes all issues for official manuals. We excluded the repos that should
typically be handled by a Documentation Team member.

Well-Known Topics
-----------------

You can also look at the open issues of a manual you are familiar with, pick one
and fix the problem.

For example:

* `Issues for this guide "Writing Documentation"
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-HowToDocument/issues>`__
* `Issues for "Getting Started Tutorial"
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Tutorial-GettingStarted/issues>`__

Advanced
--------

For Documentation Team members, members of task forces, advanced contributors:

* `All open issues in TYPO3-Documentation
  <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3ATYPO3-Documentation>`__
* `All open, unassigned issues in TYPO3-Documentation
  <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3ATYPO3-Documentation+no%3Aassignee>`__

The Docker image for rendering is in the organization **t3docs** (instead of TYPO3-Documentation):
