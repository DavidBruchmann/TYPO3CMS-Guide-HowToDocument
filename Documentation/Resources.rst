Online Resources

* Daniele Procida: `"What nobody tells you about documentation <https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/>`__
  (May 19, 2017) - A very good blogpost about different kind of manuals.
* `"8 Tips for Better Readability" by Roby Collinge
  <https://usabilla.com/blog/8-guidelines-for-better-readability-on-the-web/>`__
  is a very good resource. However, some of the tips do not concern you as
  a writer. They are only relevant for theme development. As a writer, skip
  right down to tip 5.
* `Strunk & White: "The Elements of Style <http://www.jlakes.org/ch/web/The-elements-of-style.pdf>`__
  is a classic. Many principles still apply.
