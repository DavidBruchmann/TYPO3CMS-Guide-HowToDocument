Migrate Documentation
=====================

Since May 29th 2019 a new infrastructure is in place at docs.typo3.org. This
requires some migration tasks, in order to ensure that extension documentation
is rendered on docs.typo3.org

.. _migrate-necessary-steps:

Necessary Steps
===============

.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

#. Add mandatory :file:`composer.json`, see :ref:`composer-json`

   This file is necessary, in order to determine required information, like
   vendor, package name and supported TYPO3 version.

#. Add :file:`Documentation/Settings.cfg`, see :ref:`settings-cfg`

   If this file does not exist, documentation will get rendered, but title will
   not be displayed in the left sidebar.

   This requirement may be dropped in the future.For now it is necessary to at
   least add a minimal :file:`Documentation/Settings.cfg`.

   Example for very minimal Settings.cfg, for full example see
   :ref:`settings-cfg`:

   .. code-block:: cfg

      [general]

      project = Extension name
      release = latest

#. Add new webhook, see :ref:`webhook`

   The legacy webhook is no longer necessary, as explained in
   :ref:`webhook-legacy`. Instead the new webhook has to be added as described
   at :ref:`webhook`.

   In case the old hook is in play, remove it first, and add the new one
   instead.

#. Request redirects

   Inform the TYPO3 Documentation Team, within `#typo3-documentation
   <https://typo3.slack.com/messages/C028JEPJL>`_ Slack channel. Registration
   for Slack is available at `my.typo3.org
   <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__.
   Alternatively, a redirect can be requested by commenting in `this GitHub
   issue <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/T3DocTeam/issues/92>`__.

   The team will setup the redirects from existing legacy rendering to current
   rendering:

   * legacy URL: `https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/<extkey>/<version>/`
   * new URL: `https://docs.typo3.org/p/<vendor>/<package>/<branch>/<locale>`

.. _migrate-info-about-changes:

Info About Changes
==================

.. _migrate-extension-release:

Extension Release
-----------------

The TER (TYPO3 Extension Repository) will no longer trigger documentation
rendering. Therefore uploading an extension at extensions.typo3.org does not
automatically trigger rendering anymore.

In order to release a new version of an extension:

#. Publish the extension at https://extensions.typo3.org/

#. Add :ref:`webhook` (if not already done).

#. Tag the Git commit with a valid version.

#. Publish the extension at https://packagist.org/ (This is done by Webhook +
   Tagging)

.. _migrate-version-numbers:

Version Numbers
---------------

There is no change necessary. https://docs.typo3.org/ does no longer show three
level version numbers in form of ``Major.Minor.Patch``. Only the first two
levels are shown ``Major.Minor``.

This reduces the amount of documentation while keeping relevant information, as
patch levels should not introduce breaking changes or new features.

.. _migrate-branches:

Supported branches
------------------

The rendering supports two branches within repositories:

``master``
   Should contain the current development state, used for upcoming release.
   Every push to this branch triggers a new rendering, available at
   ``https://docs.typo3.org/p/<vendor>/<package>/master/en-us/``.

``documentation-draft``
   Should contain a draft of the documentation.
   Every push to this branch triggers a new rendering, available at
   ``https://docs.typo3.org/p/<vendor>/<package>/draft/en-us/``
   (same URL as master, except *master* is replaced by *draft*).

   This is not indexed by search engines. This branch can be used to test
   rendering before releasing a new version of an extension.

   In order to test a different rendering, remove the branch, and create it
   again.

.. _migrate-existing-documentation:

Existing Documentation
----------------------

Existing legacy documentation is kept until end of 2020. Each documentation contains an
information block that it's outdated, together with a link to the necessary
steps.



In order to migrate, follow :ref:`migrate`. The Documentation Team can setup
redirects for old documentation to new documentation afterwards. Send a message
within `Slack <https://my.typo3.org/about-mytypo3org/slack>`_
`#typo3-documentation <https://typo3.slack.com/messages/C028JEPJL>`_.

.. _migrate-url-structure:

URL Structure
-------------

The URL structure has changed. Redirects are in place.

The URL structure now consists of the following parts:

`https://docs.typo3.org/<type>/<vendor>/<package>/<version>/<locale>`

Example: https://docs.typo3.org/p/helhum/typo3-console/master/en-us/

``type``
   One of:

   ``p``
      Provides documentation for composer packages (TYPO3 third party extensions)

   ``c``
      Provides documentation for TYPO3 core extensions.

   ``m``
      Provides official manuals (guides, tutorials, references).

   ``h``
      Provides the homepage of docs.typo3.org

   ``other``
      Provides further documentation, e.g. for `Surf
      <https://github.com/TYPO3/Surf>`_ or `Fluid
      <https://github.com/TYPO3/Fluid>`_

``vendor``
   Collects all packages of the same vendor, e.g. "typo3" or a company
   providing extensions. Same as on packagist.org.

``package``
   Defines the package. Same as on packagist.org.

``version``
   Defines the version, either in form of "Major.Minor" or ``master`` or
   ``draft``.

``locale``
   Defines the locale, e.g. ``en-us`` or ``fr-fr``.
