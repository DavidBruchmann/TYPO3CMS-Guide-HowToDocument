How You Can Help
================

Everyone can contribute to the TYPO3 documentation and contributions are
very much appreciated.

There are a number of things you can do to help.

.. important::
   These are just examples to get you started. You are not restricted to this,
   as a contributor. If you can make useful improvements, do it!



Make Minor Changes
==================

If you see a typo, a broken link or can make some improvements in
the spelling, do not hesitate to click on "Edit me on Github" and make
the change yourself. See :ref:`docs-contribute-github-method` for
a walkthrough.

.. _how-you-can-help-check-spelling:

Check Spelling
==============

Check spelling for consistency. For example, compare spelling of title
and headlines to `The TYPO3 Writing Style Guide
<https://typo3.org/community/teams/content/writing-style-guide/>`__ on typo3.org.

Is spelling of proper nouns correct?

See :ref:`content-styleguide` for more information, use the online tool
https://capitalizemytitle.com/ to check title spelling.


.. _how-you-can-help-fix-issues:

Fix Issues
==========

If you are a new contributor, you can look for issues in TYPO3-Documentation
with the label "good first issue":

* `"good first issue"
  <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20archived%3Afalse%20user%3ATYPO3-Documentation+no%3Aassignee>`__
* ... or go to the `Issues tab in Github <https://github.com/issues>`__ and enter `is:open is:issue archived:false label:"good first issue" user:TYPO3-Documentation` in the search field (this should get you the same result) 


Using this link, you can get a list of all open, unassigned issues:

* `Open, unassigned issues 
  <https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3ATYPO3-Documentation+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2FT3DocTeam+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2Ft3SphinxThemeRtd+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2Ft3SphinxThemeRtd+no%3Aassignee>`__ (without Documentation Team issues, without t3SphinxThemeRtd, without t3SphinxThemeRtdDemoDocs)

Pick an issue for a topic you are familiar with and try to fix it. Some of the
issues address a problem, some are enhancements where new text needs to be
written.

For more links to GitHub issues, see :ref:`links-github-issues`.


You can also look at the open issues of a manual you are familiar with, pick one
and fix the problem.

For example:

* `Issues for this guide "Writing Documentation"
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-HowToDocument/issues>`__
* `Issues for "Getting Started Tutorial"
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Tutorial-GettingStarted/issues>`__

To find the issues for a specific manual click on "Related links" (on the
bottom left of the page).

Replace Outdated Images
=======================

Replace outdated images, for example in the :ref:`t3tsconfig:start`
reference.

Look at :ref:`how-to-document-images` for information about how to
embed images with reST.

Add YouTube Videos
==================

Add some new YouTube videos from the  `TYPO3 YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpl8LY9Tr3PB26Kk2FYW_w>`__.

See :ref:`youtube-videos` for information on how to do this.

Add Information from the ChangeLog
==================================

Find information in the `TYPO3 ChangeLog <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/latest/>`__
that is not yet documented and add it to a manual where the information
is best documented, e.g.:

* :ref:`t3coreapi:start`
* :ref:`t3tsconfig:start`
* :ref:`t3tca:start`
* :ref:`t3tsref:start`


Teach and Motivate Others
=========================

If you are already familiar with the workflow, you can help others
to get started. Whenever you are at a `TYPO3 event <https://typo3.org/community/events/>`__
(Sprint, Barcamp, etc.), on `StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typo3>`__ 
or in a `Slack <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__ channel and someone finds
something missing in the documentation, help them make the
necessary changes themselves.

Thank others for their contributions (e.g. on Slack or personally).

Spread the Word
===============

`Tweet <https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23typo3>`__
(hashtag: #typo3) or blog about things in the documentation, that are 
`new <https://docs.typo3.org/News/Index.html>`__
and that you find interesting. Remind people, that everyone can contribute!


.. _how-you-can-help-review-manuals:

Review Manuals
==============

Pick a manual and start reviewing it.

If you find something that needs fixing or something is missing, either fix it or write an
issue for it and add a warning.
